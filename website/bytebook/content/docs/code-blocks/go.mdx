## Configuring Go code blocks

### Prerequisites

- The Go programming language has to be installed on your computer.
- Follow the instructions on the [Go website](https://go.dev/doc/install).

### Setting up the kernel

- [gonb](https://github.com/janpfeifer/gonb) is the kernel used by Bytebook to execute Go code blocks.

- Install `gonb`, `goimports`, and `gopls`:
```bash
go install github.com/janpfeifer/gonb@latest && \
go install golang.org/x/tools/cmd/goimports@latest && \
go install golang.org/x/tools/gopls@latest
```

- Register `gonb` as a kernel:
```bash
gonb --install
```

## Features

In Bytebook a go code block can be created in a note by typing `/go` or by typing "```go".

### Execution Model

Code that is to be executed has to be placed in a `main` function.

```go
func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
}
```

Alternatively, `%%` can be used to auto-wrap code in `main()`.

```go
%%
fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
```

### Shell Commands

Shell commands can be executed by prefixing the command with `!`.

```go
!ls -la
```

### Installing Dependencies

There shouldn't be a need to install dependencies as gonb will automatically install the dependencies for the code block. For example, gonb automatically installs the `uuid` package when running the below code.

```go
import (
    "fmt"
    "github.com/google/uuid"
)

%%
s := uuid.New()

fmt.Println(s)
```

### Plotting

gonb supports plotting using the `plotly` package.

```go
import (
    "github.com/janpfeifer/gonb/gonbui/plotly"
	grob "github.com/MetalBlueberry/go-plotly/generated/v2.34.0/graph_objects"
	ptypes "github.com/MetalBlueberry/go-plotly/pkg/types"
)

%%
fig := &grob.Fig{
    Data: []ptypes.Trace{
        &grob.Bar{
            X: ptypes.DataArray([]float64{1, 2, 3}),
            Y: ptypes.DataArray([]float64{1, 2, 3}),
        },
    },
    Layout: &grob.Layout{
        Title: &grob.LayoutTitle{
            Text: "A Figure Specified By Go Struct",
        },
        Template: plotly.PlotlyDarkTheme,
    },
}
plotly.DisplayFig(fig)
```

## Next Steps
Gonb supports many more features, such as rich text output, environment variables, widgets, and more.

For a full breakdown of everything that is supported, see the [gonb tutorial](https://github.com/janpfeifer/gonb/blob/main/examples/tutorial.ipynb)
