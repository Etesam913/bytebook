Bytebook search supports a small query language to help you find notes, folders, and attachments quickly.

## Basic search

Type one or more terms separated by spaces. Multiple terms are combined with **AND** by default.

### Examples:

Fuzzily search for all notes that contain the term "docker":

```txt
docker
```

Search for only exact matches by wrapping the term in double quotes:

```txt
"docker"
```

Search for notes that contain exactly the terms "docker" and "compose":

```txt
"docker compose"
```

## Boolean operators

You can join terms with:

- `AND` / `&&`
- `OR` / `||`

Operators are evaluated **left-to-right** (there's no parenthesis/grouping support).

### Examples:

Search for notes containing both "auth" and "middleware":

```txt
auth AND middleware
```

Search for notes containing either "auth" or "middleware":

```txt
auth OR middleware
```

Search for notes containing either "auth" or "middleware" using the `||` operator:

```txt
auth || middleware
```

## Filename & folder search

Use `f:` or `file:` to search **folder names and file names**.

### Examples:

Search for files or folders named "readme":

```txt
f:readme
```

Search for files or folders with "project notes" in the name:

```txt
f:"project notes"
```

Tip: `f:` with nothing after it lists folders (it filters results to folder documents).

## Tags

Prefix a search with `#` to search notes that contain a tag.

### Examples:

Find all notes that contain the tag "todo":

```txt
#todo
```

## Type filters

Use `t:` or `type:` to filter by document type:

- `note`
- `attachment`
- `folder`

### Examples: 

Find "auth" notes only:

```txt
t:note auth
```

Find attachments with "invoice" in the filename:

```txt
type:attachment f:invoice
```

Find folders named "docs":

```txt
t:folder f:docs
```
